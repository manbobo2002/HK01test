# URL for the running system:

# Technologies used:

# Proposed system architecture:

The reasons why I deiced to use lambda are as below:  
1. Faster Development with serverless architecture  
Only need to care about the code without handling the server.  
2. HA  
Avaliable for 7x24 and will not stop suddenly.
3. Easier Operational Management  
No need to have system administration.  

# Actual implementation of architecture:

Due to the time limitation, I did not complete the database side so this demo will be stateless.  

# How to setup:  
1. put the index.html into S3 and set it public for static hosting.  
2. put the lambda_function.py into AWS lambda function and choose python 3.7 as environment.  
3. set the post method in AWS API gateway and test the function works or not. If work, just copy the API url into the code.
